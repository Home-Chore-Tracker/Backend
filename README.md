## Background

**Pitch**

App that tracks a list of items needed for home improvement. Take a picture of the item--get led to a YouTube
page discussing topics surrounding the item. Make it fun for my kids to pitch in on the process of keeping our
chores in tact.

**MVP**

 - As a parent I can add kids to my 'family'
 - A kid can use this app on their parent's iPad or phone to see a list of the chores they've been assigned.
 - As a Kid I can see a list of the chores that have been assigned to me
 - As a parent I can assign chores to my children
 - Add a due date as to when the chore needs to be completed.
 - Kids can use the app to check off whether or not the task has been completed.

**Stretch Goal**

 - Build a randomizer that takes a list of chores, and a list of kids and assigns the kids their chores at random.
 - As a due date approaches the color of the chore changes (think red, yellow and green).
 - Game-ify it, each chore is worth X points some are worth more, the most points at the end of the week checked off.
 Checking off chores quickly gives you more points.
